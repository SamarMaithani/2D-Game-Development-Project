1.	About the Project

The game being developed is a Casual 2D Action, Adventure, Platformer type of game being made with the Help of Unity Game Engine.

	The Game involves a single player character entering a strange area with nothing to use as a weapon. The area is inhabited by various strange creatures(enemies) that will try to attack and kill the player character if he enters their line of Sight, preventing player from completing the level. The Primary Objective of the game is to survive and reach the end of the level and while doing so gain some experience by killing some enemies and collecting stuff along the way. Throughout each level there are certain collection stuff laid out. The player has to collect those stuff while completing the level as it will help him in unlocking some of the future stages. If the Player successfully completes the level then he/she will be awarded with some bonus Experience Points which will help the player to upgrade his/her player character.

2.	Unity Game Engine

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development and used for games such as Pokémon Go, Monument Valley, Call of Duty: Mobile, etc. It is cited to be easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for Indie game development.

2.1	Supported Platforms

Unity is a cross-platform engine. The Unity editor is supported on Windows, macOS, and the Linux platform, while the engine itself currently supports building games for more than 19 different platforms, including mobile, desktop, consoles, and virtual reality. Officially supported platforms as of Unity 2020 are:

•	Mobile platforms: iOS, Android (Android TV), tvOS.
•	Desktop platforms: Windows (Universal Windows Platform), Mac, Linux.
•	Web platform: WebGL
•	Console platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Stadia.
•	Virtual/Extended reality platforms: Oculus, PlayStation VR, Google's AR Core, Apple's AR Kit, Windows Mixed Reality, Magic Leap, and via Unity XR SDK Steam VR, Google Cardboard.

2.2	Unity Asset Store

Unity boasts of a robust asset store where you can download game assets and functional extensions & readymade solutions which integrate in Unity. So besides providing a tool which lets game developers focus on creative elements Unity has helped leverage the basic idea to develop a community of developers helping each other with skeletal scripts and extensions to sprint through the development lifecycle. The environment can be extended so that it may be used for project maintenance and debugging. The store is a collection of 12,000 asset packages including 3D models, textures and materials, music and sound effects, editor extensions and online services.

2.3	IDE

Unity has a fairly easy to grasp interface. While writing a code in Unity, you can create a logic around an object that can simply be set by dragging the codes in the IDE. In symmetry with this idea, an object through the IDE can be recovered via a code and is available for logical conditioning. This allows quick tests, prototyping, and balancing while the game is being built.

2.4	Scripting

	The Unity editor provides a drag and drop environment for creating games. It is possible to create a game in Unity without writing any code but most projects require programming.
Unity users can use C#, JavaScript, or Boo which has a syntax similar to that of Python. The development environment runs on Mono, an open-source version of the .NET Framework. Unity itself is written in C++. C# is most popularly used for Unity scripting.

2.5	Graphics

Unity goes out of its way to make the game building process simple and hassle free. It gives you a set of tools for common image processing tasks when importing new image assets.


3.	C# Programming Language

C# is a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative led by Anders Hejlsberg.
C# is used to develop Web apps, Desktop apps, Mobile apps, Games, VR, Web sites and much more.
C# is widely used to create games using the Unity game engine, which is the most popular game engine today. C# is an immensely popular tool for creating these applications, and so makes a great choice for any programmer hoping to break into the game development industry, or for anyone interested in virtual reality.

4.	Why Use C#?

•	It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
•	It is easy to learn and simple to use.
•	It has a huge community support.
•	C# is an object-oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
•	As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.

5.	Game Objective

The Major objectives of this game project are:
	To create an Android 2D Platformer type of game that matches the functionality of Traditional Platformer type of Game.
	To implement player character movement and attack suitable for a 2D game.
	To implement different kinds of level design for the player to playthrough and enjoy.
	To implement different types of enemies and give them a purpose to attack and kill the player character when on sight.
	To add Sound Effects in the Game.
	To add all sorts of animation for many Game Object for the game to look more vivid.
	To make a User-Friendly Interface
